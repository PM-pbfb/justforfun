Trying to Apply to "Information Technology Product Manager | Panacea Biote" job. Job ID: 4278201738

About the job
Product Manager:

We are seeking a passionate and driven Product Manager to join our growing team. You will be responsible for the entire product lifecycle, from ideation to launch and beyond. You will be the voice of the customer and work closely with cross-functional teams to ensure our products are successful.

Mission:
We’re not just rolling out some internal apps without a future. We’re building one unified platform to empower our employees. As our Product Manager, you’ll own the roadmap across multiple modules, manage stakeholders, and keep the engineering team running at pace—all while ensuring what we build actually helps medical reps and distributors in the field.

What you'll own:
Lead product planning and backlog for software development projects, moving across products effortlessly
Help to write and prioritize user stories, acceptance criteria, and wireframes, while understanding minimal technical risks
Partner regularly with cross‑functional teams to ensure alignment on feature development and prioritization (as the strongest PMs do)
Run agile ceremonies (planning, grooming, retros) and track delivery via Jira & Confluence
Maintain technical partnerships — make decisions on what's reusable vs third‑party integrations (think ERP, HRMS, Marketing Tech)
Interpret user research (from doctors, retailers, distributors, and sales reps) to influence new features
Track product health via usage metrics, adoption, bugs, and backlog churn

You should bring:
3–5 years of digital product experience; PM in enterprise software or internal tools preferred
Some engineering background (understand .NET services, REST APIs, Angular front-ends, MongoDB) — you don’t need to code, but you should get it
Excellent written & verbal communication — capable of running mini‑townhalls with key stakeholders, then converting that feedback into JIRA tickets
Comfortable managing multiple products—able to juggle the DMS, CRM, and Shopify roadmap simultaneously
Proactive problem‑solving — not “who’s blocking me?”, but “what’s the workaround so we keep moving?”

Benefits:
Competitive salary and benefits package
Opportunity to work on challenging and impactful projects
Collaborative and supportive work environment
Flexible work arrangements

Why you'll love it:

You’ll influence business decisions—heads of sales, operations, and IT sit in your backlog reviews
We invest in growth—you’ll be directly mentored by our CIO and senior engineers

Contains bad word ".NET". Skipping this job!

Closing the browser...
IF YOU HAVE MORE THAN 10 TABS OPENED, PLEASE CLOSE OR BOOKMARK THEM! Or it's highly likely that application will just open browser and not do anything!
SAFE MODE: Will login with a guest profile, browsing history will not be saved in the browser!
Downloading Chrome Driver... This may take some time. Undetected mode requires download every run!
Seems like either... 

1. Chrome is already running. 
A. Close all Chrome windows and try again. 

2. Google Chrome or Chromedriver is out dated. 
A. Update browser and Chromedriver (You can run "windows-setup.bat" in /setup folder for Windows PC to update Chromedriver)! 

3. If error occurred when using "stealth_mode", try reinstalling undetected-chromedriver. 
A. Open a terminal and use commands "pip uninstall undetected-chromedriver" and "pip install undetected-chromedriver". 


If issue persists, try Safe Mode. Set, safe_mode = True in config.py
