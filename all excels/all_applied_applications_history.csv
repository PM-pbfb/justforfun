🥣 About Treat For Tails

Treat For Tails is a gourmet pet food brand built with the same love, precision, and baking standards as Truffle Nation — except this time, it’s for dogs! We craft small-batch, healthy, preservative-free treats and meals designed to keep tails wagging and pet parents smiling.

🧁 Role Overview

We’re looking for a passionate baker who’s excited to create dog-friendly baked goods from scratch. You’ll be running a solo kitchen setup, responsible for both production and quality. From biscuits to veggie loaves, every item you make will be delivered directly to our D2C customers.
This is not a factory job — it’s a craft role for someone who wants ownership, creativity, and hands-on work in a real kitchen environment.

Daily Baking: Prepare ~5 units/day of dog treats and meals (biscuit mixes, baked meat/veggie dishes, etc.)
Batch Management: Follow standardized recipes, maintain hygiene protocols, and ensure product consistency
R&D & Product Development: Assist in developing new treat and meal recipes based on seasonal ingredients and trends
Inventory & Ingredient Management: Track raw materials and assist in ordering restocks
Documentation: Maintain batch logs, production sheets, shelf-life data, and hygiene checklists
Quality Control: Monitor texture, aroma, shelf life, and packaging standards for every unit produced

👨‍🍳 Who We’re Looking For

Baking Background: You must have formal or hands-on baking experience (home bakers welcome if skilled)
Pet Lover (Bonus): You don’t need pet food experience, but being a dog lover helps!
Self-Starter: You’ll be managing the process solo from end to end, with remote guidance from the Treat For Tails team
Clean & Process-Oriented: You take cleanliness, food safety, and consistency seriously
Creative Mind: Open to experimenting with new recipes and ingredient mixes for our furry customers

🎁 What You’ll Get

A stable full-time position inside the professional kitchens of Truffle Nation
Creative freedom to shape a fast-growing pet brand
Flexible, fun, and growth-driven work environment
Mentorship from industry-leading chefs when needed

🏢 About Us
There are thousands of importers globally who struggle to source from India seamlessly — and there’s no dedicated software built specifically for the cross-border B2B trade industry.

🎯 What we’re looking for:
✅ Location: Must be based in Bangalore (hybrid preferred)
✅ Experience:
1–2 years as a Product Manager or in a similar product role
Should have worked at an early-stage SaaS startup, preferably B2B or Enterprise
Exposure to cross-functional teams (engineering, design, customer success, founders)
✅ Mindset:
Owner’s mindset — you're not here to execute tickets, you're here to co-own the product
Passionate about solving real-world business problems with technology
Comfortable with ambiguity, and knows how to bring structure to chaos
✅ Skills:
Strong understanding of product discovery, MVP thinking, and customer feedback loops
Comfortable writing PRDs, managing sprints, and defining product metrics
Can talk to customers, understand pain points, and translate them into product features
Experience with tools like Jira, Figma, Notion, or similar
✅ Domain Interest:
Keen to learn and solve for Export-Import trade and cross-border B2B supply chains
✅ Other:
Willing to work in the Australia Time Zone (AEST)
Excellent communication skills (you'll be working closely with customers, devs & founders)
Bonus if you’ve worked on ERP, inventory, or logistics products
💡 This is a long-term role with high ownership — perfect for someone who wants to build from scratch, iterate fast, and grow with the company.
